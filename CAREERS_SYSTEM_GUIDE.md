## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure reCAPTCHA

```bash
# Run the reCAPTCHA configuration script
node scripts/add-recaptcha.js
```

Then replace `YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY_HERE` in `public/components/JobDetail.js` with your actual reCAPTCHA site key from [Google reCAPTCHA Admin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).

### 2. Update Job Data

Edit `public/data/careers.js` to:

- Add/remove job positions
- Update salary ranges
- Modify requirements and responsibilities
- Change company benefits

### 3. Customize Styling

The careers system uses the same primary brand colors defined for the demo site (see `public/styles.css`) along with a neutral gray scale for text and backgrounds. All styling is in `public/components/Careers.css` and follows the existing design system.

## URL Structure

- **Careers listing**: `/careers.html`
- **Individual jobs**: `/careers/[job-slug]`
  - Example: `/careers/hvac-service-technician`
  - Example: `/careers/customer-service-representative`

## SEO Features

- Proper meta titles and descriptions
- Schema markup for job postings
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized for local search (demo Metro City area)

## Form Handling

The application forms are currently set up for frontend validation and display. To handle actual form submissions:

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to your email system or CRM
2. **File Upload**: Set up server-side file handling
3. **Email Notifications**: Configure applicant and admin notifications
4. **Database Storage**: Store applications in your preferred system
